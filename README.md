# KSX Org Tools

A simple Google Chrome browser extension for common shortcuts in a Salesforce org with Kantata SX installed.

This extension does not require authentication, permissions, or API access, nor does it access, store, or modify any data directly in the org. Its functions and shortcuts are standardized and information is parsed solely from the current displayed page address.

This extension assumes you are operating as a System Administrator user on behalf of Kantata and that you otherwise have access to and knowledge of the areas of the system to which this extension provides shortcuts.

**You are entirely responsible for anything you do or access using this tool**. If you aren't an employee of Kantata and your supervisor has not directly instructed you in the use of this tool, do not use it.
